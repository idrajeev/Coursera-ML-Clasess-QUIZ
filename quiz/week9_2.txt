Machine Learning Recommender Systems Quiz.
===============================================================================================================================================================
Question 2.
In which of the following situations will a collaborative filtering system be the most appropriate learning algorithm (compared to linear or logistic regression)?

A. WRONG.   You manage an online bookstore and you have the book ratings from many users. You want to learn to predict the expected sales volume (number of books sold) as a function of the average rating of a book.
A. WRONG.   You're an artist and hand-paint portraits for your clients. Each client gets a different portrait (of themselves) and gives you 1-5 star rating feedback, and each client purchases at most 1 portrait. You'd like to predict what rating your next customer will give you.
A. CORRECT. You run an online bookstore and collect the ratings of many users. You want to use this to identify what books are "similar" to each other (i.e., if one user likes a certain book, what are other books that she might also like?)
A. CORRECT. You own a clothing store that sells many styles and brands of jeans. You have collected reviews of the different styles and brands from frequent shoppers, and you want to use these reviews to offer those shoppers discounts on the jeans you think they are most likely to purchase

===============================================================================================================================================================
Question 3.
You run a movie empire, and want to build a movie recommendation system based on collaborative filtering. 
There were three popular review websites (which we'll call A, B and C) which users to go to rate movies, and you have just acquired all three companies that run these websites. 
You'd like to merge the three companies' datasets together to build a single/unified system. On website A, users rank a movie as having 1 through 5 stars. 
On website B, users rank on a scale of 1 - 10, and decimal values (e.g., 7.5) are allowed. On website C, the ratings are from 1 to 100. 
You also have enough information to identify users/movies on one website with users/movies on a different website. 
Which of the following statements is true?

A. WRONG.   You can combine all three training sets into one as long as your perform mean normalization and feature scaling after you merge the data.
A. WRONG.   It is not possible to combine these websites' data. You must build three separate recommendation systems.
A. CORRECT. You can merge the three datasets into one, but you should first normalize each dataset's ratings (say rescale each dataset's ratings to a 0-1 range).
A. WRONG.   Assuming that there is at least one movie/user in one database that doesn't also appear in a second database, there is no sound way to merge the datasets, because of the missing data.

===============================================================================================================================================================
Question 4.
Which of the following are true of collaborative filtering systems? Check all that apply.

A. WRONG.   For collaborative filtering, the optimization algorithm you should use is gradient descent. In particular, you cannot use more advanced optimization algorithms (L-BFGS/conjugate gradient/etc.) for collaborative filtering, since you have to solve for both the x(i)'s and Theta(j)'s simultaneously.
A. CORRECT. For collaborative filtering, it is possible to use one of the advanced optimization algoirthms (L-BFGS/conjugate gradient/etc.) to solve for both the x(i)'s and Theta(j)'s simultaneously.
A. WRONG.   Suppose you are writing a recommender system to predict a user's book preferences. In order to build such a system, you need that user to rate all the other books in your training set.
A. CORRECT. Even if each user has rated only a small fraction of all of your products (so r(i,j)=0 for the vast majority of (i,j) pairs), you can still build a recommender system by using collaborative filtering.

===============================================================================================================================================================
Question 5.
Suppose you have two matrices A and B, where A is 5x3 and B is 3x5. Their product is C=AB, a 5x5 matrix. 
Furthermore, you have a 5x5 matrix R where every entry is 0 or 1. 
You want to find the sum of all elements C(i,j) for which the corresponding R(i,j) is 1, and ignore all elements C(i,j) where R(i,j)=0. 

One way to do so is the following code:
C = A * B;
total = 0;
for i = 1:5
  for j = 1:5
    if(R(i, j) == 1)
	  total = total + C(i, j);
	end
  end
end

Which of the following pieces of Octave code will also correctly compute this total? Check all that apply. Assume all options are in code.

A. CORRECT. total = sum(sum((A * B) .* R))
A. CORRECT. C = A * B; total = sum(sum(C(R == 1)));
A. WRONG.   C = (A * B) * R; total = sum(C(:));
A. WRONG.   total = sum(sum(A(R == 1) * B(R == 1));
